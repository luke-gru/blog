# Blog Site

Priority:

* Make site look good
  - Tags
    show how many posts are found when searching by tag
* Get email templates working on production side
  - email from which email address? Check for address on namecheap or linode
  - lookup actionmailer in production, maybe with postfix
  - test that production email templates are working
* French language translations:
    - Add french translations to blog posts
    - Add static translations
* Add comments to posts (allow markdown, and code)
  - Make them need to be approved

Long-term:
  * Add errors table for logging errors
  * Switch to postgres
