# Blog Site

Priority:

Docker:
  - Run docker locally for ruby and app
  - Add sqlite docker or another container (redis maybe) and have them talk to each other
  - Run postgres in development mode and dump all data from sqlite into postgres

Docker host:
  - Setup firewall rules to secure server
  - Install docker [x]
  - Setup application with ruby docker


* Add job tests
* Use rails caching
* French language translations:
    - Add french translations to blog posts
    - Add static translations

* Setup proper background jobs
  - See if I can use solid-queue for jobs (sqlite3)
  - Test sidekiq confirmation email is sent (with deliver_later!)
* Add comments to posts (allow markdown, and code)
  - Make them need to be approved
* Add better styling using tailwind
    - Read about tailwind components I can use, maybe blog templates or something
* Add errors table for logging errors

Other:

* Why is image attachment url a redirect url? []
* Add top menu and about page
* Fix Nokogiri::XML adding closing tags to <img>
* Create post versions?, or last_edited and only update
when a non-whitespace change has been made
* Copy editor images over to our site
* Host own fontawesome using npm and flag-icons too
* Fix favicons
 
* Look into making some posts and publishing the blog with kamal and containers
